# Project_keywordSpotter
## Idea
The idea is to develop a low-power keyword spotter hardware that recognizes the voice command "Wake up" and sends a high signal to activate a larger hardware system. This design ensures significant power savings by keeping the larger hardware in sleep mode until it receives the activation signal from the keyword spotter. The keyword spotter itself is designed to operate with minimal power consumption. A significant aspect of this project is leveraging today's generative AI tools like Chatgpt to efficiently research and design the hardware with minimal engineering effort.
## Progress
- From Chatgpt interaction 1, 2, 3 we got to know about Log mel filter bank.
